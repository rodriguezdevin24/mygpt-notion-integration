    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last Updated: March 7, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Notion Tasks API ("the API") collects, uses, and protects information. The API is a personal tool designed for single-user access, protected by API key authentication, and not intended for public use.</p>

    <h2>Single-User Design</h2>
    <p>This API is designed as a personal tool for use exclusively by its developer. It is not a commercial service, does not accept registrations, and is not intended for use by other individuals. Access is restricted by API key authentication.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>The API accesses and processes task data from a personal Notion workspace, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Task titles, descriptions, and notes</li>
        <li>Due dates and schedule information</li>
        <li>Task priorities and status information</li>
        <li>Task categories and organizational data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The data accessed by this API is used solely for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Displaying and organizing personal tasks</li>
        <li>Managing personal productivity</li>
        <li>Integration with personal productivity tools, including custom GPTs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>No data accessed or processed by this API is shared with third parties. The data remains within:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The owner's personal Notion workspace</li>
        <li>The API's temporary processing environment</li>
        <li>The owner's personal devices when retrieved via API requests</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>The API does not permanently store data outside of the Notion workspace. Temporary data may be cached during processing but is not persistently stored by the API itself.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Access to the API is protected by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>API key authentication</li>
        <li>Secure HTTPS connections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, as with any digital system, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in data practices. The updated policy will be posted at this location.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>As this is a personal tool with a single user (the developer), there is no formal contact process for privacy concerns from external parties. The developer can reach themselves through their usual communication channels.</p>

    <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
    <p>The legal basis for processing this data is personal use. The API does not process data from or about other individuals.</p>
